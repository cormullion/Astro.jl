# Astro - astronomy formulas and some time/date code in Julia

This module tries to implement some of Jan Meeus' astronomical formulas.

Contributions and improvements very welcome!

## Status

It's been updated to use version 0.4 syntax, but there are too many issues with the code...

As of 2015-09-07:

    $ cd Astro.jl/
    $ julia test/runtests.jl

although many more tests are needed to find all those bugs!

## Usage

    using Astro

What was the Right Ascension and Declination of the Moon on Feb 25 1979 at 16h00m UT?

    jd = date_to_jd(1979,2,26,16,0,0);
    geoecl_long, geoecl_lat, rad = moon_dimension3(jd);
    ra_rad, dec_rad = ecl_to_equ(geoecl_long, geoecl_lat, obliquity(jd));
    ra_deg = ra_rad / (2 * pi) |> fday_to_hms
    #-> (22,33,29.10833089183143) # RA 22 33 29.1

What phase is the moon on October 31 2014:

    jd = date_to_jd(2014,10,31,0,0,0);
    moon_illuminated_fraction_high(jd)[1]
    #-> 0.48777635849493634

What age is it:

    moon_age_location(jd)[1]
    #-> 7.302239900906831
